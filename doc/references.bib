  abstract    = "The Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is a computational
                 abstraction that represents a partial summary either of indel
                 history, or of structural similarity. Taking the former view
                 (indel history), it is possible to use formal automata theory
                 to generalize the phylogenetic likelihood framework for finite
                 substitution models (Dayhoff's probability matrices and
                 Felsenstein's pruning algorithm) to arbitrary-length
                 sequences. In this paper, we report results of a
                 simulation-based benchmark of several methods for
                 reconstruction of indel history. The methods tested include a
                 relatively new algorithm for statistical marginalization of
                 MSAs that sums over a stochastically-sampled ensemble of the
                 most probable evolutionary histories. For mammalian
                 evolutionary parameters on several different trees, the single
                 most likely history sampled by our algorithm appears less
                 biased than histories reconstructed by other MSA methods. The
                 algorithm can also be used for alignment-free inference, where
                 the MSA is explicitly summed out of the analysis. As an
                 illustration of our method, we discuss reconstruction of the
                 evolutionary histories of human protein-coding genes.",
